# AoC2020

Contains my solutions to the AoC2020 puzzles. 
Most puzzles were completed on the day of release in Python, with the exception of days 19 and 20. Code has not yet been tidied up - you have been warned.

Refer to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/) for more information on the competition. Many thanks to Eric Wastl for creating it!
