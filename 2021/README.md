# AoC 2021

Solutions for the 2021 Advent of Code puzzles.

I have chosen to attempt this year in rust as well as python just for the purposes of toying around with a new language. Rust has been voted the most loved language for 6 years or so now so it's time to see what all the hype is about.

Refer to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for more information on the competiton. Many thanks to Eric Wastl for creating it!
