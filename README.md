# Advent of Code

My solutions for the Advent of Code puzzles over the years.

## 2020

First year discovering the AoC, completed everything in Python and got absolutely hooked by the puzzles. 

Refer to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for more information on the competition. Many thanks to Eric Wastl for creating it!
