# Advent of Code

My solutions for the Advent of Code puzzles over the years.

Refer to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for more information on the competition. Many thanks to Eric Wastl for creating it!

## 2020

This was my first year discovering the AoC. I completed all 25 days in Python and got absolutely hooked by the puzzles. I was also able to complete all but 2 of the puzzles within 24 hours of their release.

## 2021

Looking to try and solve the puzzles for each day in both Python and Rust, finishing a solution in at least one language within 24 hours of the puzzle unlocking. Rust is totally new for me this year so I am expecting a steep learning curve!
